//Foreach Dim Well


//Retrieve Petra Perfs

//Retrieve OW Perfs



//  Count how many wells have perfs in OW
//Count how many wells have perfs in Petra


//Step 2
//Check overlapping perfs

//Theoretical rules
//If proposed OW 'active' perf and Petra 'proposed' perf are at the same depth, label petra perf active
//If either OW or Petra has perfs that don't overlap each other include in Petra with associated label
//IF perfs conflict, shuttle into a list that can be viewed one off in a web based system.
foreach petra perf  check and see if their is an OW perf

if both exist

//List of wells with perfs that are not in OW
//List of wells with unmatching but not contradicting perfs
